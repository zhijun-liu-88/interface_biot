This is the implementation of the unfitted finite element method for solving poroelasticity with complex geometries. The theory of the codes is included in the paper "Stabilized unfitted finite element method for poroelasticity with weak discontinuity" by Zhijun Liu et al. The numerical examples in the paper can be executed by running the corresponding Main_xxx.m files in this folder.
